## :pushpin: _How does the application work?_

You need to create an account to use the app.

After logging in, you can only see your own todo-list.

You can create, read, edit and delete todo items from database.

Each task has deadline date and separate task description.

You can sort tasks by creating date or deadline date,

or delete all tasks right away.

You can also edit your account: change username, password and email,

or delete your account from the database.

Have fun!
